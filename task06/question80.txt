What are user agent styles? Does it affect cross browser applications? What is the way out?

CSS budgets for default formatting of documents by the user agent style sheet concept, a cornerstone of the cascade. It means that a web browser doesn’t just present a line of text when it’s fed with an HTML document that has no styling information attached, but instead serves it using minimal formatting.
Different browsers set different default CSS rules,
Users/developers css overrides these default styles rest are still applied eith default user agent styles.

It does affect the cross browser applications, the same page will look different in different browsers.

To avoid this, try including a reset.css (check question31.txt) or a normalise.css (Google either one or reset vs normalise to see the differences) to remove those defaults.


For Example , open the any sample html in different and you will see the appearance is different in different browsers.
